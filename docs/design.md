# Hataori P0 Design

**Status:** Core implementation-ready; pre-implementation review verdict `Correct-to-merge`

**Scope:** A generic synchronous collective data-parallel engine for MPI ranks and rank-local Rayon execution domains

**Tracking:** [hataori-rs#1](https://github.com/shinaoka/hataori-rs/issues/1), [tenferro-rs#1716](https://github.com/tensor4all/tenferro-rs/issues/1716), [tensor4all-rs#663](https://github.com/tensor4all/tensor4all-rs/issues/663)

## 1. Positioning

### Name

**Hataori** comes from the Japanese word **機織り** (*hataori*), meaning weaving on a loom. The name reflects the engine's job: weave independent strands of work across MPI ranks and Rayon threads into one ordered result.

### Scope

Hataori makes common local, process-parallel, and hybrid data-parallel execution easy:

| Cargo features | Execution mode |
|---|---|
| none | single process, single thread |
| `rayon` | single process, multiple threads |
| `mpi` | multiple processes through upstream rsmpi, one compute lane per rank |
| `mpi,rayon` | upstream rsmpi plus one multithreaded execution domain per rank |
| `rsmpi-rt` | runtime-loaded MPI, one compute lane per rank |
| `rsmpi-rt,rayon` | runtime-loaded MPI plus one multithreaded execution domain per rank |

Hataori is inspired by Distributed.jl's dynamically scheduled `pmap`, but P0 is not a Distributed.jl-equivalent distributed object runtime. It does not provide arbitrary remote calls, futures, remote object handles, distributed garbage collection, or dynamic process creation.

The default cross-rank path uses serialization. Applications needing zero-copy communication, MPI derived datatypes, GPU-aware MPI, custom collectives, or specialized communication should use MPI directly.

### Dependency policy

The default build is standard-library-only. P0 keeps one crate with optional features rather than splitting every backend into a separate abstraction crate:

| Feature | Direct dependency added |
|---|---|
| `rayon` | `rayon` |
| `mpi` | upstream `mpi` (rsmpi), `serde`, and `bincode` |
| `rsmpi-rt` | [`tensor4all/rsmpi-rt`](https://github.com/tensor4all/rsmpi-rt) as package `mpi`, plus `serde` and `bincode` |
| Linux managed affinity | `libc` |

The optional tensor integration is a separate adapter crate depending on Hataori, tenferro, and tensor4all so those dependency trees never enter ordinary Hataori builds.

Hataori uses standard-library collections, synchronization, channels, and errors. P0 does not add an async runtime, general channel/locking crate, error-derive crate, logging facade, CLI framework, topology library, or generic transport/executor plugin system.

#### MPI backend features

`mpi` and `rsmpi-rt` provide the same Hataori API and are mutually exclusive. Enabling both is a compile error. Cargo features are additive, so every crate in one final dependency graph must select the same Hataori MPI backend; adapter crates forward these features rather than choosing a backend internally.

- `mpi` pins upstream `mpi = "=0.8.1"` with `default-features = false`; its mandatory build/link-time `mpi-sys` backend remains active while `user-operations`, `derive`, and `complex` stay disabled.
- `rsmpi-rt` uses the API-compatible rsmpi v0.8.1 fork at revision `6db6a2d6f96115b17c9a925e53ce719797c15dbb`, with `default-features = false` and only `mpi-rt-sys-backend`. Moving the pin requires the same compile and multi-rank gates as the initial pin.
- Hataori does not enable rsmpi's optional `user-operations`, `derive`, or `complex` features. P0 needs only built-in MPI operations and manually encoded protocol headers.
- A tiny private module aliases the selected crate as the MPI backend. Hataori does not introduce a public transport trait solely to hide two API-compatible implementations.

The runtime-loaded backend requires no C compiler, MPI headers, system MPI, or libclang at Hataori build time. At runtime it requires an MPIABI-compatible MPIwrapper library selected through `MPI_RT_LIB`; symbol loading is provided by `mpi-rt-sys`/`libloading`.

Hataori accepts a communicator and does not require ownership of MPI initialization or finalization. This lets an `rsmpi-rt` build share the MPI library and communicator initialized by MPI.jl or mpi4py. Both backends retain the same `MPI_THREAD_FUNNELED` and initialization-thread rules.

## 2. Architectural boundary

### 2.1 Core

Hataori core owns only generic execution concerns:

- local `map` and collective `pmap`;
- coordinator-driven dynamic scheduling;
- `Place = (rank, domain_id)`;
- rank-local execution-domain ownership and admission;
- blocking MPI transport and generic serialization envelopes;
- managed or caller-owned affinity;
- lifecycle, ordering, and error convergence.

Core treats input `T`, output `U`, and error `E` as generic values. It has no tensor, backend, cache, or provider semantics.

### 2.2 Optional integration adapter

Tensor integration belongs in an optional adapter that depends on Hataori core, tenferro, and tensor4all:

```text
hataori
    ^
    |
hataori tensor adapter ---> tenferro
    |
    +----------------------> tensor4all

tensor4all ---> tenferro
tenferro   -X-> hataori
tensor4all -X-> hataori
```

The adapter owns:

- tenferro external-domain handles and caller-managed admission mapping;
- tensor4all explicit contexts and domain-owned runtimes/caches;
- tensor logical wire representation and reconstruction in the target context;
- backend/provider checks such as BLAS or OpenMP thread policy;
- integration-specific errors and capability gates.

Neither tenferro nor tensor4all may depend on Hataori types. Hataori core must build without either dependency.

## 3. Public execution model

The public calls have this argument and return shape; feature-specific implementations apply the exact bounds in Section 12:

```rust
pub struct PmapOptions {
    pub root: Rank,
    pub batch_size: NonZeroUsize,
    pub local_mode: LocalMode,
}

pub fn map<T, U, E, F>(items: Vec<T>, f: F)
    -> Result<Vec<U>, MapError>;

#[cfg(feature = "rayon")]
pub fn map_in<T, U, E, F>(
    domain: &Domain,
    mode: LocalMode,
    items: Vec<T>,
    f: F,
) -> Result<Vec<U>, MapInError>;

pub fn pmap<C, T, U, E, F>(
    world: &C,
    domain: &Domain,
    options: PmapOptions,
    root_items: Option<Vec<T>>,
    f: F,
) -> Result<Option<Vec<U>>, PmapError>
where
    C: Communicator;
```

Here `Communicator` is the existing trait from the one selected rsmpi crate, not a Hataori transport trait. Core uses only communicator duplication, rank/size, tagged blocking send and exact-source receive, `immediate_probe_with_tag`, signed built-in min reductions, and broadcast. The two mutually exclusive dependencies expose that same rsmpi surface through a private crate alias.

`MapError` records the lowest failing input index and bounded `E::to_string()`. Serial `map` stops at the first callback error. Rayon `Sequential` and `Inner` likewise stop after the failing item. Rayon `Outer` evaluates every input exactly once in the target pool, preserves input order, then deterministically reports the lowest failed input index; it does not short-circuit admission. `MapInError` distinguishes `MissingPool`, `ForeignPool`, `DomainBusy`, and `Callback(MapError)` because only callback failures have an input index. `map_in` checks them in that order: target pool presence, foreign-pool origin, domain admission, then callbacks. `PmapError` is a core enum for preflight, domain, user, wire, and protocol failures and carries the deterministic error key and bounded message where applicable. Tensor/backend integration errors remain in the adapter.

- `map` is local serial execution and has no MPI, Rayon, or serialization requirements. `map_in` is its explicit-domain Rayon counterpart.
- `pmap` is collective: all ranks call it in the same order on the same communicator. Calling it on different communicators or in a different collective order is a caller contract violation that MPI cannot recover from.
- `pmap` collectively duplicates `world` once per call and uses only that private communicator for preflight, scheduler traffic, drain, and final convergence. This prevents collision with caller traffic; the duplicate is released only after successful convergence or recoverable-error drain.
- Only `options.root` supplies `Some(Vec<T>)`; other ranks supply `None`.
- Only `options.root` receives `Some(Vec<U>)` on success.
- Each input is evaluated exactly once in successful executions.
- Results are returned in input order, independent of completion order.
- `map` is not implemented as world-size-one `pmap`.

Hataori does not transmit closures. All ranks run the same binary and construct `f` at the same SPMD call site. Root-only captured data must be included in input or distributed explicitly.

## 4. Place and execution domain

A place is:

```text
(rank, domain_id)
```

A domain is a multithreaded execution resource, not a Rayon worker thread. P0 supports exactly one domain per rank, so only `domain_id = 0` is valid. The value model leaves room for multiple domains later without implementing a registry or selection policy now.

A core domain contains only Hataori-owned execution facts:

```text
Domain
├─ domain_id
├─ Rayon pool handle, when enabled
├─ declared or verified CPU set
├─ worker budget
├─ pool ownership mode
└─ nonblocking running slot
```

It never contains tenferro or tensor4all types.

At most one coarse operation is admitted per domain. Admission is nonblocking and RAII-managed. Contention returns a typed `DomainBusy` error; a worker never blocks waiting for admission.

## 5. Affinity and lifecycle

### 5.1 Hataori-managed mode

Managed mode creates and owns one Rayon pool from an explicit CPU set and worker count.

On Linux, managed placement is strict and verified:

- the CPU set must be a subset of the process's actual allowed CPUs;
- a worker start hook pins each worker to a distinct declared CPU, records its outcome without panicking, and signals a standard-library channel;
- after `ThreadPoolBuilder::build` returns, construction waits with a bounded timeout until every start hook reports; any pin failure or missing report drops the owned pool and returns a typed construction error;
- pin failure, duplicate assignment, an out-of-range CPU, or too many workers is a construction error;
- placement is reported as `Verified`.

On non-Linux targets, P0 uses a documented degraded managed mode: Hataori still creates, owns, and shuts down the pool, but treats the CPU set as a declaration, performs no pinning, and reports placement as `CallerDeclared`. In particular, macOS affinity tags are not CPU binding and Apple Silicon core quality is outside Hataori's contract. Strict affinity assertions run only on Linux; the scheduling, transport, and bounds suites run on every supported target.

Hataori owns pool shutdown and does not infer a second resource policy from global Rayon state, `RAYON_NUM_THREADS`, `from_env`, or automatic topology discovery.

### 5.2 External-managed mode

External mode accepts a caller-owned pool plus declared CPU set and worker budget.

- Hataori never re-pins workers.
- Hataori never shuts down the pool.
- It validates only observable facts and reports whether placement is verified or caller-declared.
- A pool injected first and pinned afterward by Hataori is not supported.

The core constructor does not accept a tenferro handle. The optional adapter associates backend handles and contexts with the core `DomainId`.

## 6. Intra-domain execution modes

`LocalMode` is always defined so `PmapOptions` has one shape across MPI backends. Without Rayon only `Sequential` is accepted; with Rayon an operation selects one generic fan-out policy:

```rust
enum LocalMode {
    Sequential,
    Outer,
    Inner,
}
```

- `Sequential`: no local fan-out; the callback must remain sequential.
- `Outer`: Hataori evaluates every independent item exactly once in the selected domain, preserves input order, and reports the lowest callback-error index after all item results are available; each item must not perform another competing fan-out.
- `Inner`: Hataori presents items sequentially and admits the callback as the sole coarse operation for the domain. The callback may use the domain's full declared `worker_count` through that same pool.

P0 intentionally has no partial inner budget. Rayon cannot cap arbitrary nested same-pool work to fewer than the pool's workers without another scheduling mechanism, and tenferro's motivating contract asks for the complete supplied executor. A future partial budget requires a real backend need and a separately tested mechanism.

`Inner` is a generic core resource contract, not a tenferro-specific variant. The callback still has the ordinary `Fn(T) -> Result<U, E>` shape and obtains no core executor handle. An optional adapter may capture its explicit tenferro/tensor4all context, verify before execution that it belongs to the same domain pool, and then enter tenferro's borrowed same-pool API from the callback. Core neither constructs a second pool nor imports backend types.

`Outer` and `Inner` are mutually exclusive for one operation. Synchronous entry from a foreign pool is rejected before the callback runs.

## 7. Dynamic P0 scheduler

### Collective preflight

A small thread-local RAII guard rejects recursive `pmap` on the MPI initialization thread before any MPI call. Subject to that collective precondition, ranks duplicate the caller communicator and enter one preflight before any `READY`/`TASK` traffic. Preflight checks initialization-thread identity, supported MPI thread level, root and option agreement, `0 <= root < world_size`, exactly one root payload on the designated root, no payload elsewhere, domain identity/mode validity, local domain admission, and that the largest possible deterministic error key is strictly less than the reserved `i64::MAX` no-error sentinel. Error-key overflow or sentinel collision is a typed preflight failure. Locally acquired RAII admission guards remain held through the call. Signed built-in reductions converge any validation failure so every rank either enters the scheduler or returns the same typed error; no rank returns alone while peers enter protocol traffic.

Collective call order, communicator identity, and non-reentrant participation on every rank are API preconditions rather than recoverable preflight checks: ranks that do not enter the same collective call cannot communicate enough to diagnose that misuse.

### Scheduling protocol

P0 uses coordinator-driven dynamic scheduling rather than static rank chunks. It targets coarse items whose compute time is much larger than one `READY` round trip.

```text
READY(rank, domain=0)
    -> TASK(batch_id, indexed_items, payload)
    -> RESULT(batch_id, indices, status, payload)

READY(rank, domain=0)
    -> STOP
    -> DRAIN
```

- The root owns a FIFO queue of indexed items. In fixed-input P0, the checked original input index is also the stable `task_key`; no separate task-ID field is transmitted.
- Batch size is a fixed positive call parameter; the default is 1. Batch IDs start at zero and increase monotonically with checked overflow.
- Each domain, including the root's, has `running <= 1` and `prefetched = 0`.
- Every remote `READY` receives exactly one `TASK` or `STOP`.
- `READY` supplies backpressure; P0 has no credit, acknowledgement, heartbeat, retry, cancellation, cost model, or adaptive batch policy.
- The root restores order with an O(N) indexed result table.

The root retains the input queue and result table, so the input plus all returned payloads must fit in root memory. P0 does not stream results to external storage.

The root rank participates in computation through its own domain. The scheduler assigns it an owned batch directly, without a self-addressed MPI message or serialization. Root-local idleness acts like `READY`, and local completion makes the domain eligible for another batch. Calling the root-dispatch transition while its lane is running is a typed protocol error and leaves state unchanged; only an idle root with no assignable work becomes stopped. This keeps all ranks useful, including world size one, while preserving the same capacity and ordering rules as remote domains.

The MPI initialization thread drives all communication and the root scheduler. With Rayon, root uses `ThreadPool::in_place_scope`: its non-`Send` scope body stays on the calling MPI initialization thread, while `Scope::spawn` sends the borrowed callback task into the root's explicit pool. The task reports completion through a rank-local standard-library channel. This exact primitive, rather than `ThreadPool::scope` or `install`, preserves FUNNELED identity and scoped non-`'static` borrowing.

While root-local work is running, the initialization thread checks local completion and services at most one `MPI_Iprobe`-detected message per loop iteration, alternating priority when both remain ready. A detected message is consumed with the ordinary blocking receive path. When neither source is ready, the loop calls `std::thread::yield_now`; P0 adds no progress thread, timer policy, or async runtime. This rule is simple, testable, and prevents either source from starving.

Without Rayon, the existing MPI-only bounds do not require `Send`, so the root executes its local batch synchronously on the initialization thread. MPI progress may pause for at most that batch's callback; after it returns, the root resumes receiving before assigning more work. This preserves scoped non-`Send` execution and eventual rendezvous progress, but does not promise communication progress during an MPI-only root callback.

`MPI_Iprobe` is permitted only for root event multiplexing. P0 data transfer remains blocking: it has no `Isend`, `Irecv`, request lifecycle, prefetch, or background progress. The coordinator has no dedicated CPU in P0.

### Normative domain state transitions

Remote domains follow exactly these transitions:

```text
Idle -> ReadySent -> Running -> ResultSent -> Idle
Idle -> ReadySent -> StopReceived -> Drained
```

A successful or failed batch produces exactly one complete `RESULT` frame, followed by the normal `READY` path. Completion always validates lane state, batch ID, count, and the exact original-index sequence, including after a prior failure. Validation is a full first pass: protocol errors leave the result table and lane state unchanged. On a valid success after failure, decoded values are discarded after validation; the lane still returns to idle and then follows `READY` to `STOP`. When a corrupt header makes its batch ID untrustworthy, transport marks the running lane failed through a dedicated coordinator transition that uses the coordinator's pinned `RunningMeta.batch_id`, never the received ID; this guarantees the next valid `READY` receives `STOP`. `DRAIN` is sent exactly once, only after `STOP`, callback completion, and completion of every announced send. The root domain follows the same logical states without `READY`, `STOP`, or `DRAIN` MPI messages. A callback panic is not recoverable: under `panic=unwind` the callback boundary catches it only to request `MPI_Abort` from the initialization thread; under `panic=abort` the process terminates directly.

The coordinator is implemented as private pure state transitions over queue, in-flight, result, and rank-state data. Tests drive those transitions directly; P0 adds neither a public nor private generic transport trait. The MPI loop is a thin caller of that state machine.

## 8. Error and drain protocol

After the first recoverable error:

1. the root stops assigning new work;
2. every current or later `READY` receives `STOP`;
3. already assigned batches finish or fail;
4. every announced length and payload is received or drained;
5. each rank sends `DRAIN` once stopped and idle; root-local work is likewise completed and drained before convergence;
6. after all ranks drain, one final collective selects the deterministic winning error;
7. the winning bounded UTF-8 error message is broadcast.

In preflight, a failing rank contributes its rank and a passing rank contributes `world_size`; signed `MPI_INT`/`MPI_MIN` therefore selects the lowest failing rank or `world_size` when all pass. The selected failing rank broadcasts its typed validation error. After scheduling begins, each recoverable error has a canonical tuple `(task_key, class, reporting_rank)`: `task_key` is the stable task ID when one exists and the checked input length for call-level errors, while `class` is a fixed internal ordinal for wire/protocol, user callback, and drain. The key is checked as `((task_key * ERROR_CLASS_COUNT + class) * world_size + reporting_rank)` in the nonnegative range of `i64`; no-error is `i64::MAX`. Final convergence uses `MPI_INT64_T`/`MPI_MIN`, then the encoded reporting rank broadcasts a message capped at 4096 UTF-8 bytes and truncated only at a character boundary. There is no collective after every batch and no custom MPI reduction. P0 deliberately avoids unsigned `MPI_MIN`, which produced incorrect results in [MPICH 4.0.2](https://github.com/pmodels/mpich/issues/6083) and [Open MPI 4.1.4](https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/issues/10648).

Recoverable errors must not return early and strand a blocking sender. Process death, OOM, callback panic, MPI transport failure, or rank loss requires `MPI_Abort`; these are not converted into `PmapError`.

Only one high-level `pmap` may be active on an MPI initialization thread. A small RAII reentrancy guard is sufficient; P0 has no communicator registry.

## 9. MPI thread model

P0 targets `MPI_THREAD_FUNNELED` behavior.

- MPI-only execution accepts an externally provided `MPI_THREAD_SINGLE` or stronger runtime because no other thread executes during the callback. Hybrid execution requires at least `MPI_THREAD_FUNNELED`. A stronger provided level does not relax Hataori's rules.
- Only the thread that initialized MPI may call MPI, and externally initialized runtimes are checked with `MPI_Is_thread_main` rather than assumed.
- Communicators never enter Rayon closures.
- A mutex does not permit MPI calls from another thread under FUNNELED.
- Hataori adds no unsafe `Send` or `Sync` implementation for communicators.
- P0 transfers data with blocking MPI and has no background progress thread.
- Root may call `MPI_Iprobe` on that same initialization thread solely to multiplex MPI arrivals with root-local completion.

## 10. Generic wire and locality

Cross-rank values use one fixed bincode 2 serde configuration:

```rust
bincode::config::standard()
    .with_fixed_int_encoding()
    .with_little_endian()
```

Each message uses a fixed header tag followed, when nonempty, by one payload tag from the same source on the private communicator. The fixed-width header contains protocol version, message kind, batch ID, item count, status, and `u64` payload length. Status is a checked scheduler tag; the wire codec treats payload bytes as opaque, while each scheduler/transport message kind defines its payload schema in the task that consumes it. Capacity one means a rank never has two payloads outstanding. Receivers first match the header, then receive exactly its announced payload from that source; no wildcard payload receive is allowed.

`MAX_WIRE_BYTES` is `i32::MAX` for P0, matching rsmpi's MPI `Count`. Length is checked against that limit and local `usize` before allocation or send. Decoding validates the received MPI count, every integer conversion, protocol version, message/state compatibility, expected structure, and full byte consumption. Truncation, overflow, unexpected kind/tag/source, and trailing bytes are protocol errors.

Same-rank movement is an owned move and bypasses serialization and MPI. Distributed `pmap` retains serde bounds because placement is decided at runtime; callers needing non-serializable local work use `map`.

Core transports only opaque serializable `T` and `U` values or bytes. Tensor shape, dtype, layout, allocation, and target-context reconstruction belong to the optional tensor adapter. Closures, communicators, pools, contexts, admission state, cache identity, and addresses never appear on the wire.

## 11. Data placement helpers

P0 provides three synchronous collective, root-coordinated helpers that reuse the same private-communicator, wire, preflight, and error rules. All ranks call each helper in the same collective order:

- `broadcast`: copy one root-owned value to every rank;
- `scatter`: distribute rank-local owned shards;
- `gather`: collect one rank-local owned value from every rank.

Returned values are caller-owned. The root's same-rank contribution is always an owned move and never enters the codec for any helper. P0 has no remote registry, cross-call object cache, remote references, or distributed garbage collector.

## 12. Trait bounds

P0 uses scoped synchronous execution and does not add `'static` for hypothetical future overlap.

| Entry point | Bounds |
|---|---|
| serial `map` | `F: FnMut(T) -> Result<U, E>`; `E: Display`; no serde, `Send`, `Sync`, or `'static` |
| Rayon `map_in` | `T/U/E: Send`; `F: Fn(T) -> Result<U, E> + Send + Sync`; `E: Display`; no `'static` |
| MPI-only `pmap` | `T/U: Serialize + DeserializeOwned`; `F: FnMut(T) -> Result<U, E>`; `E: Display`; no `Send`, `Sync`, or `'static` |
| hybrid `pmap` | MPI bounds plus `T/U/E: Send`; `F: Fn(T) -> Result<U, E> + Send + Sync`; no `'static` |

`E` is moved from a worker and does not require `Sync`. Shared-data APIs add `Sync` only where actual sharing requires it.

## 13. Tensor integration contract

The optional adapter establishes this ownership chain:

```text
Hataori domain
  -> tensor4all explicit context and domain-owned runtimes/caches
    -> tenferro caller-managed external domain
      -> the same Rayon pool
```

Required tenferro capabilities:

- caller-managed external CPU admission that bypasses the process-global CPU arbiter;
- synchronous borrowed same-executor entry from a caller-owned pool;
- no second pool, blocking admission, or public-backend recursive entry;
- typed errors for unsupported reentry and budget violations.

Required tensor4all capabilities:

- explicit context entry points for plain, graph, and eager AD paths;
- no fallback to `DEFAULT_CPU_CONTEXT`, `DEFAULT_BACKEND`, `DEFAULT_GRAPH_RUNTIME`, `DEFAULT_EAGER_RUNTIME`, `from_env`, or a global backend mutex;
- backend/runtime/cache ownership scoped to the domain context;
- typed rejection of cross-context compiled-object or workspace reuse.

Tensor transport contains only logical host data and metadata. The receiving rank reconstructs the tensor in its target domain context. Executor, admission, runtime, and cache identities are never serialized.

## 14. Provider threads

Core does not encode tensor provider policy. The tensor adapter must account for all provider threads within the selected CPU budget.

The default hybrid integration requires single-threaded BLAS/OpenMP providers. Thread counts are configured before execution, not changed while operations are running. An integrated mode is rejected when provider behavior cannot be verified or would introduce an uncontrolled thread source.

## 15. P0 hard failures

Core rejects before work begins:

- more than one domain per rank;
- ambient/global Rayon or hidden pool construction;
- `map_in` on a sequential domain with no pool;
- synchronous foreign-pool entry;
- invalid or unverifiable Linux managed placement;
- invalid external ownership declarations;
- worker or background-thread MPI calls;
- domain admission contention;
- requests for nonblocking data transfer, prefetch, background progress, or dedicated-coordinator behavior.

The build rejects simultaneous `mpi` and `rsmpi-rt` features.

The optional adapter separately rejects:

- duplicate Hataori and tenferro CPU admission;
- unavailable caller-managed same-pool capability;
- tensor4all global-default fallback;
- context/cache mismatch;
- uncontrolled provider threads;
- conflicting Outer/Inner backend fan-out.

Backend-specific errors do not enter the core error enum.

## 16. Acceptance criteria

### Core scheduling and transport

- Empty input, more ranks than inputs, batch size 1, and fixed batch size greater than 1 work.
- Every successful input executes once and root results preserve input order under reverse completion order.
- A skewed workload demonstrates meaningful improvement over static contiguous partitioning.
- Instrumentation proves `running <= 1`, `prefetched = 0`, bounded resident batches, one complete `RESULT` per assigned batch, and exactly one `STOP`/`DRAIN` transition per remote rank.
- With Rayon, large rendezvous-sized remote results make progress while the root domain computes; root event polling does not starve local completion.
- Without Rayon, the root participates synchronously, preserves the MPI-only non-`Send` bounds, and resumes rendezvous progress after each finite local batch.
- World size one executes every input through the root domain without MPI self-messages or serialization.
- Simultaneous user/decode errors converge on one deterministic signed-key winner without deadlock; tests cover unsigned values that failed in affected MPI releases.
- Preflight disagreement or local validation failure causes every rank to return before any scheduler message is sent.
- A caller communicator is reusable after a recoverable failure, and private-communicator traces contain no unmatched header or payload.
- A test-only private MPI-call wrapper asserts `MPI_Is_thread_main` at every call site.
- Hybrid root uses `ThreadPool::in_place_scope`; borrowed callback data remains valid and the coordinator scope body stays on the MPI initialization thread.
- Same-rank serialization count is zero under an instrumented codec.
- Version, kind, tag/source, length, count, overflow, truncation, and trailing-byte errors are typed.

### Domain and affinity

- On Linux, managed workers remain on distinct declared CPUs within the launcher/cgroup allowed set and placement reports `Verified`.
- On non-Linux targets, managed mode performs no pinning and reports `CallerDeclared`; all non-affinity suites still run.
- External pools are neither re-pinned nor shut down.
- Global Rayon is never entered.
- Admission is reacquired after success, error, or unwind.
- Foreign-pool entry fails before execution.

### Compile-time boundaries

- Scoped local and hybrid execution can borrow non-`'static` data.
- MPI-only use is not forced to satisfy Rayon `Send`/`Sync` bounds.
- Local non-serialized use is not forced to implement serde.
- No communicator or backend receives an unsafe thread-safety wrapper.
- Core's feature matrix builds without tenferro or tensor4all in its dependency tree.
- Default and Rayon-only builds contain no MPI, serde, or bincode dependency.
- `mpi` and pinned `rsmpi-rt` revision `6db6a2d6f96115b17c9a925e53ce719797c15dbb` each build the same Hataori MPI API; enabling both fails at compile time.
- An `rsmpi-rt` build succeeds without MPI headers, a C compiler, or libclang, then passes a multi-rank smoke test with `MPI_RT_LIB` set.
- Hataori can use a caller-supplied communicator without owning MPI initialization/finalization.

### Three-repository integration

- Hataori's running slot is the only coarse CPU admission.
- tenferro's CPU arbiter is not acquired in caller-managed mode.
- Same-pool inner fork/join creates no pool or OS thread and does not panic or deadlock.
- tensor4all plain, graph, and eager AD paths all use the explicit target context.
- Global/default tensor runtime sentinels remain untouched.
- Remote tensor reconstruction occurs in the target context and serializes no execution identity.
- Outer and Inner each have exactly one fan-out owner.
- Managed and external modes respect the declared total thread budget.

## 17. Explicit P0 non-goals

- Arbitrary `remotecall`, spawn, futures, task graphs, or task registries
- Controller-generated task insertion or an expanding work queue; this is a separate P1 candidate
- Remote object handles, channels, distributed reference counting, or distributed GC
- Dynamic process creation; ranks are owned by the MPI launcher or scheduler
- Transmitting Rust closures or executable code
- Nonblocking data transfer, prefetch, request pipelines, or background MPI progress
- Using `MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE` semantics or relaxing Hataori's single-MPI-thread rule
- Multiple concurrently scheduled domains per rank
- A dedicated coordinator CPU
- Automatic topology or NUMA discovery and memory-placement guarantees
- Adaptive batches, cost models, retries, cancellation, heartbeats, or fault recovery
- A generic `Executor`, `Place`, or `Domain` trait hierarchy
- A process-global Hataori CPU broker or tensor cache
- Zero-copy, MPI derived datatypes, GPU-aware MPI, or custom transport/codec abstractions

## 18. P1 gates

P1 work is demand-driven, not predesigned into P0.

### Nonblocking overlap

Prototype init-thread `Isend`/`Irecv`/`Test*` with at most one running and one prefetched batch. Productize it only if:

- exposed communication/serialization wait is at least 15% of wall time in a real workload;
- across at least seven runs, median end-to-end time improves by at least 10%;
- representative compute-heavy and small-payload regressions are at most 5%;
- memory remains bounded by two resident batches per domain;
- FUNNELED identity, ordering, draining, and reuse remain correct.

Only a detached/overlapped entry that truly requires ownership may add `Send + 'static`; those bounds must not leak into P0 scoped APIs.

### Other P1 candidates

- a controller-driven expanding queue, only after a real workload defines bounded pending-memory and determinism requirements;
- multiple disjoint domains per rank, after caller-managed backend admission is proven;
- a dedicated coordinator policy, only if progress latency is measured as a bottleneck;
- NUMA-aware placement or multithreaded providers, each behind separate correctness and performance evidence.

## 19. Completion definition

P0 is complete only when:

1. Hataori core scheduling, transport, affinity, bounds, and error tests pass;
2. tenferro provides and tests caller-managed admission and same-pool borrowed entry;
3. tensor4all provides and tests explicit plain/graph/eager-AD contexts with no default fallback;
4. the optional adapter passes the joint ownership, admission, context, wire, and thread-budget gate;
5. Hataori pins known-good tenferro and tensor4all revisions.

Core may ship earlier, but integrated tensor compatibility must not be claimed before the joint gate passes.
